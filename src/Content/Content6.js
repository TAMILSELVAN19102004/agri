      First of all, to do a planche you need to have not only strength, mobility and midline stability, but this exercise above all also requires patience, nerves of steel and infinite determination. You cannot jump into this without specific preparation. Remember also that the planche is quite advanced and it is not recommended for everybody.

For instance, if you have an injury to recover or weight to lose, the planche is not for you. If you are new to hand balancing, you simply want to build strength, or you have problems with wrist weakness or stiffness better stay away from the planche for a while. Nevertheless, these don’t mean that you cannot perform this exercise in your life. Firstly, you have to manage these issues, then you can start to work on.

Last, but not least, the planche is an ultimate exercise which braces the core. Though, having a background in gymnastics is helpful. You can practice this exercise basically everywhere because you don’t need any equipment. This move base only on your muscles strength so performing the full planche for 5 seconds is a great achievement.

      Achieving the straddle planche is a bit more fluid and depends on your personal preferences. There are plenty of exercises which bring you closer to your goal. Preferably, choose two of them to concentrate on at the time. During three weeks focus on these two, then switch them out for others for another cycle. Check out the variations below.

Straddle Open Tuck Hold requires beginning with the tuck planche. Next, pull your knees apart and hold. In case of Tuck Push Back to Half Straddle variation, you should start with the tuck planche, as well. Push your knees apart and back into a half straddle, and repeat. After, prepare to Tuck Push Back to Open Tuck Planche by moving your knees back until they are floating in an open tuck planche.

While performing another step, Tuck Push Back to Single Leg Planche, you have to push one leg back into a single leg planche. Finally, Tuck Push Back to Straddle Planche variation requires straightening the legs into a full straddle planche from the tuck. Conduct this exercise with a pause, a longer hold, then try to repeat for conditioning.

Don’t be afraid to modify these variations, but try to stay with chosen modifications for a few weeks to precisely learn how to do them correctly. The repeatability of these exercises allows you to achieve a satisfying result faster.

      In the end, check out, the icing on the top, the planche pushups. The standard push-up is a great exercise to train your chest, shoulders, and triceps, as well as your core. The planche push-ups are the challenging variation. To master this exercise, you will also need several weeks or months of regular training.

First of all, set your final goal. This is the full version of the planche push-up. You do need strong pecs and triceps but must also understand how to leverage your body weight by using your core. You should practice crow, a yoga pose, which also helps you develop the control and core strength.

The first step, lie on your belly on the ground and extend your arms by your hips. Next, put your palms on the floor, so they are in line with your abdomen. Turn your fingers out to the sides of the room.

Then, press up into the top of a push-up position. Lean your weight forward into your chest and shoulders, squeeze your legs together and engage your abs in lifting both feet and legs off the floor. Finally, bend your elbows to lower your chest to the ground. Keep your lower body elevated the entire time. Extend your elbows back up to complete one repetition.
