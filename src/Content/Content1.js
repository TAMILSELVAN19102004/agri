        <p className='p1'>When we think about stretching, we usually match this term with the action of trying to make our muscles more elastic and flexible by keeping them for a short/medium time range (seconds) in a position of stress that leads them to go beyond their usual length (i.e. stretch).

Now, if we wanna be more specific, whenever we talk about the term “stretching” we should think of it as:

“the physical activity meant to increase the length of the muscles, muscle groups, tendons and soft tissues, throughout the actions of flexing and stretching.”

As you can see, the definition above, is just one of many that you can find as it doesn’t exist a specific common one.

By keeping in mind such definition, now we can go more in depth of when stretching should be performed and when not, how to approach a stretching movement and how many techniques are existing.

<p className='p2'>
 The most common way of stretching a muscle or group of muscles by starting from a relaxed position of both antagonist and agonist muscles.

The stretching movement starts when, from the relaxed position, you are going to apply slowly more tension on the muscle or muscle group and by holding that position for a certain amount of time (usually seconds).

Following up the stretching movement, comes then the release phase where instead you should always go back to the starting relaxed position progressively in order to not hurt the muscle or group of muscles just stretched.

It is perfect for sedentary people and, in general, for all those who are beginners (and not only as every type of stretching brings different overall benefits).

The most typical example of such type is the one where you sit on the floor in an L position where your legs as well as your back are straight.

The stretching movement implies then to progressively bend over and try to reach the tip of your feet with your hands by keeping always your back in line and not bent.

In this way your hamstrings, calves and lower back are under tension for a specific time range that can go from 20 seconds (minimum time range required to start to feel the muscles lengthen).

<h2 className='clg'>Active Stretching </h2>

Active Stretching this type of stretching is very useful and can be actually included in between the regular exercises that are part of your workouts, to help activate your body before going deeper into the workouts.

It can also be used apart, as it is a form of stretching that focuses on applying tension on the muscle or group of muscles targeted without any assistance nor support.

In particular, among the most common types of active stretching exercises we can have the one where you lay in a starting supinated position on the floor with legs straight and arms wide open on both sides.

By rotating one leg at a time in the opposite direction of where it was laying, you stretch the hips as well as the lower back and as you can see, you actually stretch such parts by performing a dynamic movement.

Another dynamic stretching movement can be the one that focuses on your shoulders and in particular, the one where you have your arms wide open on both sides, this time starting from a standing position (on feet).

By rotating the arms firstly clockwise and then counterclockwise, you will actually stretch and activate the rotator’s cuff, again by performing a dynamic movement.
