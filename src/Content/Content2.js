        full body routine you will focus more on compound exercises that will involve multiple muscles at a time, avoiding so the isolating ones (typical of Split routines).

This difference translates into a significant gain in terms of strength and mass growth; consider that it is sufficient to train just the regular average 2-3 times a week to see such improvements.

Also fact that, the volume/repetitions you will be able to perform will significantly increase is another element to consider.

As we all know, time is the most important variable and by adopting such kind of training you can save up a lot of it and be able to include, in the rest days, those activities considered complementary/of support to the workouts of the week.

So, once again, try to include in the rest days a good session of stretching in order to use a time range of 60 up to 90 minutes so that you can focus on flexibility; the same can be said for mobility where a good foam rolling session is a MUST.

In this second case, try to be creative and use again a time range of 60 up to 90 minutes more or less (it takes me this time to massage all the trigger points in my body by using the foam roller together with the massage ball/trigger ball).

To give you a very good example on which you can meditate, I will report here a part of the topic discussed by Steven Low in his book “Overcoming Gravity: A systematic approach to gymnastics and bodyweight strength”:

“To drive this point home, let us look at something like the planche exercise. In the above split routine examined it would be categorized into a pushing exercise. Therefore, you would get practice with it twice a week. However, with the full body routine we are getting practice with that 3 times a week. It does not seem significant, but over the course of a year that is 50 more workouts with the planche with the full body routine than with the split routine!

        To summarize what explained above, we can say that training with a full body routine will allow you to considerably increase the work volume by performing more repetitions/sets of each exercise and, at the same time, keep growing in strength and body mass.

More important, you will be able to make steps in the skills progressions in a shorter time lapse without the risk to injure or to over train.

To conclude this first analysis we can say that with a Calisthenics full body routine (as mentioned also in previous articles) you follow a propaedeutic progression to achieve the advanced stages of each skill.

By doing so, you will be working all the time involving all muscles in your body starting from the core all the way through biceps, triceps, chest, lats, shoulders, traps, legs, calves and so on.
