        <h3>Hands:</h3> positioned slightly wider than the length between your shoulders and angled in a way that makes you most comfortable. When looking for a way to relieve your wrists, try turning the hands slightly inward or just do the push-ups on your knuckles (semi-soft surface preferred).<br></br>
<h3>Feet:</h3> set up in a way that feels right. So, in other words, it depends on you if you put them shoulder-width apart, or as close as it’s possible. But for the stability’s sake, it’s best to keep them apart.<br></br>
<h3>Body:</h3> extended so that you can balance on your hands and toes. Your body should be kept in a straight line – no sagging, no arching!<br></br>
<h3>Abs and core:</h3>ontracted and tightened! Just pull your belly button toward your spine, and it should be OK.<br></br>
<h3>Head:</h3> in line with the body! Look at what’s in front of you, not down at the floor. It will help you keep your body in line.<br></br>

       <h3> Problems with the body line:</h3> The push-ups – as said – are a total-body move. So when your lower back starts sagging or arching keep your focus on tightening your glutes and legs.<br></br>
<h3>Forgetting about Breathing:</h3> This is one of the most important parts of the push-up workout, and unfortunately, there’s no better tip than just: way down – inhale, way up – exhale.<br></br>
<h3>Flying elbows:</h3> Keep them close to your body and do not let them fly out. If your elbows start forming letter T along with your arms and shoulders – take five.<br></br>
<h3>Neck pain:</h3> When you’re suffering from neck pain during a push-up, it means that you strain your neck and your forehead lowers first, not the chest as it’s supposed to be. You should immediately shift your head’s position into neutral one – just stare in front of you, not down at the floor.<br></br>
<h3>Wrists not under shoulders:</h3> At first, it might even feel easier to shift your weight back slightly while doing a push-up. But as it takes a load of workout off your chest (literally), it’s a bit like cheating and makes the push-up workout less effective in general. Let your shoulders sit directly on top of your wrists then!<br></br>
