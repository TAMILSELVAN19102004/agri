        HAMSTRING SCISSORS STRETCH: from a standing position, keep your back and legs straight opened into a scissors position and slowly lean forward until you reach the point of tension in your hamstrings so to begin the stretch.
Make sure to hold the position of stretch for 10-15” seconds maximum, then release and go on to the next hold; remember, you don’t wanna stress the muscles, but stretch them.

HAMSTRING STRETCH (LAY SUPINE): a very common exercise that is usually performed by laying supine down on the floor.
It can be performed with the assistance of a towel, a resistance band, a partner or, where possible, of a wall.
Such stretch implies the extension towards the ceiling of one leg at a time; while keeping the leg up and by using an assistance such as a towel or a resistance band, place them on top of your foot sole, so to have a solid pulling point.
From that point, while breathing always with your diaphragm, start to pull down the towel or the resistance band towards your chest in order to stretch the hamstrings and vary the intensity
<br></br>
<br></br>
KNEELING HAMSTRING STRETCH: another important stretch that can be performed without any assistance, but just by kneeling on the ground with one leg while the other one extends in front of your body.
Place both hands to the sides of your hips and slowly start to lean forward while keeping head up, back and leg extended straight so to favor a deep stretch in the hamstrings.
Make sure to hold the position not longer than 10-15” before switching the leg
<br></br>
<br></br>
JEFFERSON CURL: in my opinion, a very effective hamstrings stretch exercise that is performed by using a small weight as an assistance.
Start from a standing position on top of a cube or plyometric cube or more in general an elevated surface with enough range that allows you to bend over with your back and go below the line of your feet with your hands.
Grab a barbell or kettlebell (you can choose the weight, but I recommend around 12-16kg would be enough) and from the top of the cube let’s say, slowly bend over letting the weight of the barbell/kettlebell dragging down your upper body into a deep pike stretch.
The goal is to breathe with your diaphragm and relax your back and hamstrings so to favor a stretch that reaches a point below the line of your feet.
Hold that new position of stretch for 10” at least and before starting the comeback, make sure to follow the same line you followed to bend over

GOOD MORNING STRETCH: this exercise is very well known to be a very effective one for working on glutes as well as hamstrings strengthening.
It can be seen also as a sort of hamstring stretch if performed without any load, but maybe just by using a PVC or a stick upon your shoulders to help the movement.
By starting from a standing position, place your feet shoulder-width apart and start slowly to bend over with back and legs slightly bent while holding a stick or PVC pipe upon your shoulders.
After reaching the point where your upper body forms a straight line parallel to the ground, hence that should be a fair point of stretch, come all the way back to the top and repeat.
