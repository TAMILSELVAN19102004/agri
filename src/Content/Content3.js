        This exercise requires a well-developed core. Abdominal muscles and lower back allow for keeping the torso and legs parallel. They are here stabilizers of your figure. Without the proper
strength of your loins, your legs will fall. Without a developed abs, you will not reach a position parallel to the ground. In this figure, your body is involved from the shoulder muscles to the feet, which symbolizes the harmoniously and proportionately developed figure.
In the Internet, we can set eyes on many ways of progression in order to make the correct front of the lever. However, I assume that the more combining, the smaller the effect. There aren’t
magical ways. In the case of body sports, the most effective method will be to stay at the old school.

        In the final movement of the tuck lever, being in a horizontal position to the ground, you unlock your knees slightly forward to be in the “sitting” position (the paradox is that you aren’t sitting) and create between quadriceps and calves an angle of forty-five degrees or similar. This position is called open tuck. If you’re tired of practising this figure, go back to tuck lever. You take one step back to make two forward. Using this metod ,you will be able to achieve the best, optimal results

Another element of progression is front tuck with leg extention. This is a move that will improve you core and torso muscles. It’s all about doing the front tuck (at the maximum tilt back), and then straightening one of your legs towards the sky, as if you wanted to touch it by your foot. You’re still keeping your second leg correctly with the front tuck scheme. If you have a problem with doing this exercise, back to practice the previous variation. Patience is a guarantee of success here.

        When performing front tuck with leg extension, namely in the position where one of your legs is maximally straightened and the other one is bent, you activate the core (you tense the abs)and slowly begin to lower your body, so that it’s parallel to the ground.

At the beginning, it’s not easy for you to straighten your body in a straight line. Just try to go lower and lower.

This is a half-front lever, because you don’t have to straighten the second leg to the full front of the lever.

However, it isn’t as simple as it may seem. It requires a lot of work. Practice, practise and practice once again. When you’re ready, try to straighten out your second leg and do your first front lever. Let everything go smoothly, follow every step mentioned in this guide conscientiously. Remember. Practice makes perfect.
