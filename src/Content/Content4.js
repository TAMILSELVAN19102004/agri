        Now, when you look at the scientific side of fat loss, it is is extremely easy and extremely simple. If you look at fat loss from a sales point of view however in this deluded fitness industry, the concept becomes far more complicated than it really needs to be!

From performing 1 hour ineffective ab workouts to jugging down 2 scoops of protein powder (followed by sitting on the toilet for 30 minutes the next day), I eventually had enough of following the advise from these so called ‘experts’, and therefore made it my mission to get to the underlying truth of how fat loss really worked.

(And also so I could get those washboard abs I dreamt of every night…I wanted them so damn bad, man!)

If you could only take one thing away from this article, let it be this: “Once you understand the principles, application is easy.”

        In short – a calorie deficit is a state in which you consume less calories than your body burns. And with that said, consuming less calories than you burn is the ONLY way in which you can lose body fat.

For example – if I burn 2500 calories a day, I will only lose body fat if I consume less than 2500 calories a day. You can try all the fancy diets, ab circuits, or spot reduction methods you’d like, but if your body is not in a consistent calorie deficit, you will NEVER lose body fat!

        Although cardio is a great way to improve your cardiovascular health whilst burning some additional calories in the process, cardio is NOT the solution to fat loss.

As said earlier, fat loss comes from being in a calorie deficit where you’re consuming less calories than you’re burning. With that said – if you’re endlessly eating poor quality nutrients and then heading to the gym to go on the treadmill for an hour in order to ‘burn those extra calories off’, you’re literally spinning your wheels…but heading nowhere!

Yes, you can use cardio to aid your fat loss journey, but only use it to supplement your plan, as doing too much too soon only leads to burn out (as I’ve had to learn the hard way in the past!).
