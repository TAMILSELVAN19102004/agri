            Leg lifts are exercises which allow you to perfectly work out your abs. Keep in mind that during this exercise your legs are slightly activated. You can easily adjust the level of the difficulty and intensity to your physical condition. If you are wondering how lying leg raises, follow these easy steps to do it right.
            Lie down on the floor, or the mat with your legs stretched out a front of you. You have to keep your hands down flat on the ground near your sides, with palms down. If you experience back pain, roll a towel and place it under your back, just above your hips. You can perform leg raises on a workout bench instead of on the floor; it will increase your range of motion and allow you to lift or lower your legs farther.

Next, bend your knees and raise your legs. Your toes should be pointed while doing exercises. Keep your thighs perpendicular to your body and your shins parallel. Contract your abdominals. This helps you to push your lower back into the floor. There should not be any gap between the floor and your back. This allows you to target your abs without hurting your spine. Keep your eyes and face directed at the ceiling. If you have a feeling that your head and neck are moving too much, lift your chin up a little.

Carefully straighten your legs and point your feet at the ceiling. Raise your legs and make sure that your lower back is in contact with the floor. In this way, you perform a precise workout, and you avoid injuries. Note if you can do the second step easily, skip it. Raise your legs without bending them and give yourself a harder workout.

        When you perform hanging leg raises you must remember about a correct body posture. You have probably heard about the posterior pelvic tilt caused by muscle imbalances in the lower body. It can pull the pelvis down and under, flattening out the lumbar lordosis from the bottom. The posterior pelvic tilt can not only damage your posture, but it also leads to unbearable back pain and muscle imbalances severely lowering your capacity for functional movement.

The best way to reset your pelvis into a neutral position and treat the symptoms of posterior pelvic tilt is to stretch and lengthen the muscles that have become short and tight. You should also strengthen and coordinate the agonist and antagonist stabilizer muscles to eliminate imbalances causing a posterior pelvic tilt. Remember about training and improving neural control in functional movements to ingrain the proper patterns in the movement.

        The L-sit, an acrobatic body position, in which you support the whole body on your hands, combines strength, power, and coordination. This kind of exercises requires regular practice and a bit of patience. Don’t worry! L-sit is entirely doable and achievable if you follow steps below.
        Undoubtedly, L-sit is much more complicated than it looks. Most of the people try to just jump right into by throwing their legs out in front of them. Give yourself time and take a deeper look at the l-sit progression. By following these manageable steps, you will succeed.

First, sit on the floor in the piked position. Keep legs straight out in front of you. Put your hand on the floor next to your hips and straighten your arms. Remember to keep them locked up. Lift your bottom off the ground with your shoulders and drive your hands into the floor. Then, carefully tighten your core to lift your feet up off the floor. Try to keep your legs straight and point your toes to tighten up your legs. Next, bring your hips through your arms, slightly in front of your hands, to keep your feet up off the ground.

While doing L-sit, you have to master three elements. First of all, the shoulder mobility is essential. You have to be able to move your shoulders down to lift your body off the ground. Secondly, you need a strong core and hip flexion. These allow you to tighten up your body and lift your legs off the floor. Last, but not least, a solid back which let you maintain balance.
